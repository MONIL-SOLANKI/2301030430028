        <div class="container">
            <p>We provide information for practical art therapy techniques as well as essential business resources to help you establish and grow your Art Therapy business. Our business resources will also help general mental health therapists who do not have an Art Therapy specialty.</p>
            <p>The content provided on Art Therapy Resources can be used exactly as described or as a guide for tasks developed by the Art Therapist. Responsibility for treatment resides with the individual therapist who understands their client’s specific needs.</p>
            <p>The information provided on Art Therapy Resources is written based on current scientific literature available with the understanding that future development in knowledge will occur.</p>
            <p>The art therapy exercises provided on the site should be undertaken within the context of the human development cycle including young children through to older adults. It is the responsibility of the therapist to determine whether an exercise is age appropriate for their specific client.</p>
            <p>The suggested art therapy exercises you will find on the website should be used at the discretion of the art therapist based on the client’s individual needs. Art therapy exercises should not be viewed as a prescription on how to treat a client that presents with a specific range of problems.</p>
            <p>Art Therapists should be mindful that working with clients requires an attitude of responding to your client’s needs in the moment rather than based on prescriptive techniques. With this in mind, the suggested exercises on the Art Therapy Resources website are presented as a guideline to use along with your own therapeutic intuition based on your client’s needs.</p>
            <p>For new art therapy professionals, these art therapy exercises will help you build a database of knowledge to draw upon when developing your client treatment.</p>

            <h3>PAINTING TYPE ART : </h3>
            <img src="C:\xampp\htdocs\WT\img\img3.jpg">
            <p style="margin: 20px;"> --> In the beginning, I began painting things that I saw around me; sometimes, it was beautiful scenery or a particular incident, such as a boy helping an elderly man cross the road. Although my paintings were not perfect, I was happy that I could capture such memorable moments through my art. Slowly, I perfected the art by painting from my imagination and seeing things from a different perspective. I would like to highlight an incident in this essay on a painting I made.</p>
            <h3>DRAWING TYPE ART : </h3>
            <img src="C:\xampp\htdocs\WT\img\download (10).jpg">
            <p style="margin: 20px;"> --> Drawing by itself is an art that gives peace and pleasure. Furthermore, learning the art of drawing can lead to efficiency in other mediums.  Also, having an accurate drawing is the basis of a realistic painting. Drawing has the power to make people more expressive. It is well known that the expression of some people can’t always take place by the use of words and actions only. Therefore, drawing can serve as an important form of communication for people.</p>
            <h3>ART & CRAFT : </h3>
            <img src="C:\xampp\htdocs\WT\img\download (11).jpg">
            <p style="margin: 20px;"> --> First of all art and craft is the activity of making things with hands. Generally, art and craft is a hobby. As a result, it is mostly liked by kids. On the other hand, adults also like this. There are lots of schools in this world where students can learn about this activity. Art and craft are gaining increasing importance in all aspects of life. Along with the development of science, logic, and math; art and science are essential for a harmonious and peaceful development of society.</p>
            <h3>ART & DESIGN : </h3>
            <img src="C:\xampp\htdocs\WT\img\download (12).jpg">
            <p style="margin: 20px;"> --> When dealing with art and design specific demographics and viewers interpret the messages of each subject in different ways. Art is said to be elucidated and design is said to be understood. Artists usually develop a work of art with the intention of bringing an emotion viewpoint, instinctive feeling, and or state of mind. When you look at an artist work it cannot be limited to just exhibiting one individual thought or just one individual meaning.</p>
